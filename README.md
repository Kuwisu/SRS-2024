This GUI program allows you to view waveform and spectrogram graphs and modify various parameters. 
<br>The application currently is only tested and deployed for Windows systems.

## Installation Instructions
Download `release.exe` and `base-ui.ui` and run the executable in the same folder as the UI file.
<br>Additionally include `.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.flac` sound samples to visualise their properties.

## Use Instructions
On the Import tab, click "Select Audio File" and select one of your sound samples. This will automatically generate a waveform graph in the upper plot.
<br>Optionally, you can modify the audio's sampling rate on the Resample tab. 
<br>On the Create Spectrogram tab, you can modify various parameters and click "Generate Spectrogram" to generate a spectrogram image in the lower plot.
